This is my solution to the Codecademy Censor Dispenser Challenge Project/

I chose to censor the proprietary terms and negative words with a fixed lengthblank to make it more difficult to infer the original word by it's context and length, but when censoring words either side of them for the full censor function I replaced them with equivalent length blanks to demonstrate how to do so.
